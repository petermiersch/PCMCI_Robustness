# parameters for causal discovery
discovery:
  pc_alpha: 0.05 # PC algorithm hyperparameter
  tau_max: 7
  sample_selection_seed: 42 # to make the sample selection reproducable
  peak_sample_sizes: [100, 200, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000] # set of number of samples used in training, 0 indicates using all possible data with only 1 fold
  min_folds_per_basin: 5 # minimum number of folds (=runs of the PCMCI) for each sample size
  max_folds_per_basin: 10 # maximum number of folds (=runs of the PCMCI) for each sample size
  pcmci_verbosity: 0 # controls the verbosity (how detailed the outputs are) of the pcmci algorithm

# parameters to configure runtime of slurm jobs
slurm:
  runtime_ParCorr: 240 # runtime in minutes for a single basin using ParCorr
  runtime_GPDC: 600 # runtime in minutes for a single basin unsing GPDC (running on GPU)
  memory_ParCorr: "8G" # memory per core (only single core used) for ParCorr
  memory_GPDC: "8G" # memory per core (only single core used) for GPDC. This is not the GPUs Vram, but the memory of the compute node. Memory of the GPU has to be spcified by the GPU model.
